Hooke's Law & Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

There are two methods (Hooke's Law and SHM) that can be used to determine the spring constant of a spring. 

    Which one of the two methods is more precise and how large is the difference in precision?
    Brainstorm ways to estimate and minimize uncertainties for your measurements.
    Specify which variables are independent and dependent for each method and list any controlled variables.
    Do the values of the spring constant from the two methods agree within their uncertainty ranges?
    submit a LaTeX summary with your results, include any relevant graphs, and ways that you used to minimize uncertainty.
