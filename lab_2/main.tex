\section{Results}
We designed two different experiments to measure the $k$ value a given spring.
Both experiments made use of the \begin{equation}
    F_s = -k\cdot x
    \label{eq:hookes}
\end{equation}
where $F_s$ is the spring force acting on an object, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium point of the spring.
In our first experiment, we used five different masses and statically analyzed the system to find a $k$ value of $9.49 \pm 0.1 \left[\frac{N}{m}\right]$. (see \hyperref[fig:data-1]{Figure \ref{fig:data-1}})
In our second experiment, we dynamically analyzed the system while it was is simple harmonic motion (SHM). We found the $k = 9.3 \pm 0.1 \left[\frac{N}{m}\right]$. (see \hyperref[fig:data-2]{Figure \ref{fig:data-2}})

While each of the measurements were equally uncertain, we decided that the measurement using both of the Lab Quest sensors was more precise, and had less variability than Experiment 1 did. We also decided the system in Experiment 2 was able to stay more stable and constant, while everything done in Experiment had some variability from things shaking due to the movement of the lab group.
